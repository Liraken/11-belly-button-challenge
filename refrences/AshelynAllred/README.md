# Belly Button Challenge
Data Visualization dashboard of belly button biodiversity using D3.js and Plotly.js, implementing various charts that dynamically update upon selecting a dropdown option populated via data returned from an API call.

## Where to find everything
The code is available in the `static/js` folder.

I have this dashboard deployed [on my GitHub Pages](https://ashelynallred.github.io/belly-button-challenge/) if you want to see it in action!

## Citations
I referenced github user [Kokolipa's repository under the same name](https://github.com/Kokolipa/belly-button-challenge) to get over some of the intial difficulties on how to start with the project. I also collaborated with Emilia Sanchez, specifically with figuring out the bubble chart.
